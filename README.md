# Llama Detector

_In progress..._

A web page that detects llamas through your camera.

## Instructions

Load it up and point your camera at a llama. If you don't have a real llama to hand (ðŸ˜¦), you can try pointing it at a picture or video of a llama.

When a llama is detected, you will be rewarded appropriately.

Please note: This is a Llama Detector. Alpacas are not llamas. Trying to fool the Dector with an alpaca is cheating and cheating is wrong. Go take a long, hard look at yourself. Yes, you. We know your type. ðŸ˜’

## Development

Uses [Tensorflow.js]() and the [MobileNet trained model]().

It's all client-side, so to develop locally you can serve the page using any static hosting server, for example `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
