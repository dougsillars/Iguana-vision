# Llama Detector

_In progress..._

A web page that detects llamas through your camera.

## Instructions

Load it up and point your camera at a llama. If you don't have a real llama to hand (sad ðŸ˜¦), you can try pointing it at a picture or video of a llama.

*Please note:* This is a _Llama_ Detector. Trying to fool the Dector with an alpaca is plain cheating and cheating is wrong. Go take a long, hard look at yourself. Yes, you. We know your type. ðŸ˜’

## Development

Uses [Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) and the [MobileNet pre-trained model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md).

It's all client-side, so to develop locally you can serve the page using any static hosting server, for example `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
